# FI
Fundamental invariant polynomials for several prototypical systems

The method is described briefly in "Fitting potential energy surfaces with fundamental invariant neural network. II. Generating fundamental invariants for molecular systems with up to ten atoms". J. Chem. Phys. 152, 204307 (2020); https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0010104

The work is based on "Communication: Fitting potential energy surfaces with fundamental invariant neural network". J. Chem. Phys. 145, 071101 (2016); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4961454 and https://github.com/kjshao/FI. 

We would prefer both the paper above to be cited if you use the dataset.
